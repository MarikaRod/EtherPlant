EtherPlant
==========

A simple web page to code in Etherpad and visualize in PlantUML.

#### Architecture

I'm no good at UML, but I made a diagram to try to show the architecture of EtherPlant:

#### Warning

The code is not big, but was made in a few hours, so it's not good to look at... Feel free to submit patches.
